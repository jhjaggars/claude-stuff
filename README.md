# Requirements Workflow

1. Use /requirements-start "description of stuff I want" to generate the pr
2. commit, push to main, create a new gh issue with the requirements
3. run work-issue.sh $gh_issue_number to start the workflow
4. wait (do something else!) for assignment to the PR for manual review
5. provide feedback / merge / close the PR
